## My process
1. Building the html structure for the project.
2. Figure out layout pattern for flex elements before transforming block level elements to flex items.
3. Transform block level elements to flexboxes.
4. Sort out width for each flex item.
5. Finding solution to errors on resources such as 'google,'w3schools','stackoverflow'.
4. Implementing solutions.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- [CSS font stack](https://www.cssfontstack.com/) - For font stacks


### What I learned

Styling page cleverly using CSS properties:
1. Using flexbox - Very useful to build responsive webpages. Resource to learn fundamentals of Flexbox from - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u044iM9xsWU. Very
easy to understand.

2. Quick fix for responsive padding - This algorithm adjusts the size of your webpage and smoothly changes and always looks in balance when screen size
differs. Resource to learn more about it's working - https://matthewjamestaylor.com/responsive-padding

```html
<div class="content">
</div>
```

```css
.content{
  padding: calc(8px + 1.5625vw);
}
```


### Continued development

- To gain proper understanding of flexbox, learn layouts of flex items at different ratios as needed.
- Learn to use media-query for building responsive layout at varying screen
sizes
- Learn responsive web design.
